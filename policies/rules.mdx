## Discord Server Rules
Our Discord server is the core of our community — please help us keep it welcoming and professional.

### Use Polite and Respectful Language
Always communicate with courtesy.  
Avoid using harsh, offensive, or disrespectful words toward other members or staff.

### Forbidden Content
Sharing **NSFW**, **SARA**, **illegal**, or **harmful content** is strictly prohibited.  
This includes media, links, or discussions that violate public morality or the law.

### Smart Mention Usage
Do not mention users, staff, or roles unnecessarily.  
Mentions should only be used when relevant to the conversation or support.

### Promotions Require Admin Approval
Advertising products, services, or other servers without explicit permission from the **LokaNode Team** is not allowed.

### Avoid Spam and Abuse
Do not spam messages, flood channels, or engage in activities that disrupt community comfort.  
Repeated abuse may result in a **mute**, **kick**, or **ban**.

<Note>
  Respect and collaboration are the foundation of our community — treat others the way you want to be treated.

## Product Purchase Rules
These rules apply when ordering or managing hosting services through the LokaNode billing platform.

### Read Before You Buy
Always check the **product description, specifications, and terms** before purchasing any plan.  
Make sure it matches your needs to avoid future issues.

### Delivery Time
All orders are processed and activated **within 3×24 hours** after payment confirmation.  
You will receive credentials and access via email and the billing dashboard.

### No Refunds or Exchanges
All transactions are **final and non-refundable**, except in cases of technical error or fault from LokaNode’s side.

### Ask Before Ordering
If you are unsure about a product, configuration, or billing, please **contact an admin first** before completing your purchase.
