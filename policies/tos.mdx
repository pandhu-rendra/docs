## Data Security & Backups
You are fully responsible for maintaining and securing your own data backups.  
While LokaNode provides high reliability, we **cannot guarantee data recovery** in the event of user negligence, deletion, or external interference.

<Tip>
  Tip: Regularly back up your files via the Control Panel or set up automated backups for maximum safety.

## Use Your Server Wisely
Please use your hosting plan according to its capacity and intended purpose.  
Overloading your allocated CPU, RAM, or storage may lead to performance degradation or automatic throttling by the system.  
If you consistently hit the limit, consider upgrading to a higher plan for better stability.

## Fair Resource Usage
To keep all services running smoothly, excessive or abusive usage of shared resources is strictly prohibited.  
Any form of activity that negatively impacts other users’ performance — such as running heavy background tasks or unauthorized scripts — may result in **temporary suspension or limitation**.

- Hosting or distributing illegal content
