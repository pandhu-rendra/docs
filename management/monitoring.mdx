## Live Metrics at a Glance

Your monitoring dashboard displays:
- **CPU Load:** Tracks server processing power usage.
- **Memory Usage (RAM):** Watch for memory saturation that may cause lag or crashes.
- **Disk Utilization:** See how much storage is left for backups, worlds, or data.
- **Network Throughput:** Monitor incoming/outgoing traffic trends.
- **Uptime Status:** Continuous tracking of your server’s operational time.

<Info>
  You can view data updates every few seconds — perfect for diagnosing spikes or bottlenecks.

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Log in to your **Server Panel**.  
2. Open your **Active Service**.  
3. Go to the **Monitoring** section to view live resource graphs.

<Note>
  The graphs are automatically refreshed and don’t require manual reloads.

## Interpreting the Data

| Metric | Normal Range | Watch Out For |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| CPU Usage | 20–70% | 90%+ sustained → possible overload |
| RAM | 30–80% | 95%+ constant → upgrade or restart |
| Disk | < 80% | 90%+ → clean logs or expand storage |
| Network | Stable traffic | Sudden spikes → check DDoS or heavy plugins |

## Best Practices

- Check your dashboard **daily** — especially after installing plugins or mods.  
- Use consistent monitoring to plan **when to scale your plan**.  
- Export historical data for deeper analysis.  
- Set up alerts (coming soon!) for critical thresholds.

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** Combine Monitoring with Auto Backup to keep performance data and recovery points aligned.

<Note>
  LokaNode’s monitoring system uses secure, isolated data collectors — meaning your metrics stay private and are never shared externally.
