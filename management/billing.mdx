## Understanding Your Invoice
Each invoice contains detailed information, including:
- **Service Name & Billing Cycle**  
- **Amount Due**  
- **Payment Method** (QRIS, Credits, or Manual)  
- **Invoice Status** (*Pending*, *Paid*, *Expired*)

Invoices are generated automatically when you order or renew a service.

## Payment Options
You can complete your payments using one of the following methods:

- **QRIS** – Scan and pay using any supported banking or e-wallet app.  
- **Credits** – Pay instantly using your existing account balance.  
- **Manual Confirmation** – Contact our support team if your payment doesn’t auto-confirm within a few minutes.

<Tip>
  Always double-check your invoice status after payment to avoid duplicate transactions.

## Managing Account Credits
Credits allow for faster and seamless checkout.  
To add funds:
1. Go to **Dashboard → Account → Credits**.  
2. Choose your **top-up method** and complete the payment.  
3. Your balance updates automatically after confirmation.

Credits do **not expire** and can be used for any future purchases.
