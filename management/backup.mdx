## Backup Process
- Backups run **every midnight (server time)**.  
- Each backup includes your **entire server directory** and **configuration data**.  
- Older backups are **automatically rotated** to maintain optimal storage efficiency.  
- You can still create **manual backups** anytime through the panel.

## Managing Backups
1. Log in to your **Server Control Panel**.  
2. Navigate to **Backups**.  
3. From there, you can:
   - **Create a Manual Backup** instantly  
   - **Restore** your server to any available backup  
   - **Delete** unnecessary backups to free space  

<Tip>
  Tip: Always keep at least one recent backup before updating plugins, mods, or configuration files.
</Tip>

## Best Practices
- **Monthly Off-Site Storage** — download one backup per month for long-term safety.  
- **Before Major Changes** — always create a manual backup prior to major updates.  
- **Verify Regularly** — ensure your backups are listed and recent in the control panel.

<Note>
  All backups are stored in isolated, secured storage and are not accessible publicly for your protection.
