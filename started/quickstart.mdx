  <Step title="Step 4: Payment">
    Select a payment method: **QRIS** or **Credits**.
    - For QRIS: scan the code after clicking Pay, then check the payment status.
    - For Credits: ensure sufficient balance and pay with credits.
    If the QRIS expires or fails, refresh the invoice to get a new QR code.
